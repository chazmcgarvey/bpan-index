The [BPAN](https://github.com/bpan-org/bpan#readme) Package Index


## Synopsis

This video shows how a BPAN release is done from the command line.
The ([`bashplus` package](https://github.com/bpan-org/bashplus#bashplus))
author runs:

* `bpan bump --push` - Prepare/Push BPAN package's the next version release
* `bpan release` - Submit the new release to the BPAN Index updater
* A comment is posted to [this GitHub issue](
  https://github.com/bpan-org/bpan-index/issues/1)
* That triggers a [GitHub Actions workflow](
  https://github.com/bpan-org/bpan-index/actions/runs/3119660793/jobs/5059761235)
  to:
  * Verify that the BPAN Package release is OK
  * If OK, update the [BPAN Index](
    https://github.com/bpan-org/bpan-index/blob/main/index.ini)
  * Notify the author of Success üëç or Failure üëé
* This actual [`bashplus` 0.1.17](
  https://github.com/bpan-org/bashplus/tree/0.1.17) release is logged [here](
  https://github.com/bpan-org/bpan-index/issues/1#issuecomment-1257059529)

## Description

This repo contains the [BPAN Package Index](
https://github.com/bpan-org/bpan-index/blob/main/index.ini) that BPAN uses to
find its packages, and the [BPAN Author Index](
https://github.com/bpan-org/bpan-index/blob/main/author.ini) of registered BPAN
package authors.

It also contains the GHA workflows that manage the updating of the indexes.

The BPAN Index is how the BPAN CLI client finds BPAN packages to for people to
install.


## Registration

Registration and Release requests are posted by the BPAN CLI commands:

* bpan register --author    Register to become a BPAN author
* bpan register --package   Register a new package (first release)
* bpan release              Release subsequent BPAN package versions

Registration is a one time event for each new author and package.
It submits a Pull Request to this repository and you'll need to wait for a
maintainer to merge it.

Package Release on the other hand is fully automated by GitHub Actions.
When you run `bpan release` it will:

* Check to make sure your release looks good
* Issue a triggering comment
* Print the URL to the comment so you can watch and wait
* Trigger a GitHub Actions workflow
* This will do more checks on your release
* If the release looks good it will update the BPAN index
* If not, you can follow a link to the log to see what's up
* In either case you should be notified of the result
